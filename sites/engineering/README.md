# Engineering site

The Engineering site is for provisioning Jenkins instances used by the Engineering team.

There is only a single variant for now:

| Variant   | Release name | Cluster   | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `nonprod` | `jenkins`    | `cs1-dev` | Main Jenkins instance for Engineering team |

All samples will be deployed to the `engineering` namespace.
