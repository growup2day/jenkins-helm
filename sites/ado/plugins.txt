# This file allows plugins to be installed that override or are in addition to the ones in the base ANZ jenkins image:
# https://bitbucket.nz.service.anz/projects/OP/repos/jenkins/browse/ocp-4.x/jenkins-base/contrib/openshift/base-plugins.txt

# Determining the version of a plugin to use is not straight forward. Each plugin defines its own minimum base jenkins
# version that it requires, and this requirement is occasionally bumped when a new version of the plugin is released. If
# the version of jenkins is too old the plugin will fail to load when jenkins starts. This problem can be compounded by
# plugins that depend on other plugins with higher based jenkins version requirements than their own. Therefore
# determining the correct version becomes a process of analysing the plugin's github source and jenkins.io page,
# monitoring the logs of the plugin dependency resolution when openshift builds the base Jenkins image, and
# checking the "manage jenkins" page in Jenkins for plugin errors once deployed.
